  title = {Uptake Kinetics of Heavy Metals from Water Using a High Surface Area Supported Inorganic Metal Oxide.},
  abstract = {Efficient removal of radionuclides from water is extremely important given recent events, such as the Fukushima nuclear disaster.  Supported calcium-contg. inorg. metal oxide may be able to rapidly exchange with radionuclides from an aq. environment.  The feasibility studies were performed and the uptake kinetics of cobalt, thorium, cerium, and cesium from soln. were measured.  The uptake and rate consts. were detd. using pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order rate laws.  The applicability of these rate law models to the system was compared and contrasted to other models, notably Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models. [on SciFinder(R)]},

  title = {Selectivity and Kinetic Behavior of Heavy Metal and Radionuclides on Supported Ion-Exchange Adsorbant.},
  abstract = {The removal of radionuclides by selective concn. from seawater is an esp. attractive goal since oceans contain valuable materials, although at low concns.  Radionuclide sources include natural abundance and seepage plus that which is due to industrially generated wastewater streams and nuclear incidents.  Challenges include the selectivity required for the low concns., high material vols., and high ionic strengths.  To address these problems, a recently available supported ion-exchange adsorbent was detd. by kinetic assay to be selective for uranium from simulated seawater.  These assay were also preformed for neodymium, lead, cobalt, strontium, cadmium, cesium, copper, thorium, barium, chromium, and nickel adsorbates, chosen due to either their presence in common wastewater streams or as surrogates for more exotic radionuclides.  The adsorbent was also tested using groundwater and lake water, each doped with analyte ions.  Anal. of the data revealed properties about the exchange mechanism regarding the Langmuirian growth of the analytes on the adorbant and leaching during subsurface migration by target ions.  Under simulated conditions, the test material was able to conc. heavy ions on the surface of the exchange interface with particular selectivity for uranium. [on SciFinder(R)]},

  volume = {61},
  abstract = {A hybrid ground-airborne sensing network for real-time plume monitoring of CO2 and CH4 for carbon sequestration is investigated. Conventional soil gas monitoring has difficulty in distinguishing gas flux signals from leakage with those associated with meteorologically driven changes. A low-cost, lightweight sensor system has been developed and implemented onboard a small unmanned aircraft and is combined with a large-scale ground network that measures gas concentration. These are combined with other atmospheric diagnostics, including thermodynamic data and velocity from ultrasonic anemometers and multi-hole probes. To characterize the system behavior and verify its effectiveness, field tests have been conducted with simulated discharges of CO2 and CH4 from compressed gas tanks to mimic leaks and generate gaseous plumes, as well as field tests over the Farnsworth CO2-EOR site in the Anadarko Basin. Since the sensor response time is a function of vehicle airspeed, dynamic calibration models are required to determine accurate location of gas concentration in space and time. Comparisons are made between the two tests and results compared with historical models combining both flight and atmospheric dynamics.},

  title = {Development and {{Applications}} of {{Chemical Sensors}} for the {{Detection}} of {{Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide}} and {{Methane}}},
  abstract = {This is a description of the design of a low-power, low-cost networked array of sensors for the remote monitoring of carbon dioxide and methane.  The goal was to create a scalable self-powered two-dimensional array for the detection of these gases in a large area.  The sensor selection, electronic design, and data communication was studied and optimized to allow for multiple units to form a self-assembling network for acre-scale coverage with minimal human intervention.  The final electronic design of the solar-powered units is flexible, providing a foundation for future field deployable remote monitoring devices.  Sensors were selected for this application from commercially available models based on low-power, low-cost, market availability, detection range, and accuracy around the global baseline criteria.  For environmental monitoring, carbon dioxide sensors are characterized near 400 ppm and methane from 2 to 200 ppm.  For both gases, exertions up to several 1000 pm were examined to mimic large releases.  An Xbee mesh network of radios was utilized to coordinate the individual units in the array, and the data was transferred in real-time over the cellular network to a dedicated server.  The system was tested at a site north of the Oklahoma State campus, an unmanned airfield east of Stillwater, OK, and an injection well near Farnsworth, TX.  Data collected from the Stillwater test sites show that the system is reliable for baseline gas levels.  The gas injection well site was monitored as a potential source of carbon dioxide and methane leaks due to the carbon dioxide injection process undertaken there for carbon sequestration and enhanced oil recovery efforts.  The sensors are shown to be effective at detecting gas concentration at the sites and few possible leak events are detected.},
